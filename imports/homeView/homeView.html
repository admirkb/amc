        It's good to not have to do a lot of scaffolding work to create a simple application. This startup shows how
        to user MeteorJS together with Angular JS 2 plus NodeJs and MongoDB. Meteor handles the reactive part of the application
        and allows us to easily inform clients of changes to our tables. We will initially create a simple bug tracker system
        that has options to create a new records, delete records, retrieve records and change records. If you open up multiple
        window for the application you will see rows in the collection being set to  red and disabled when one user goes into
        edit mode.

        Further screens cover maintenance of users and roles. The roles can be assigned to individual users and we further use
        roles to hide/show menu items. If you are not in the role for a particular menu option you will not see this.
        Data is further controlled via the roles option. To see everything in the database you will need admin role. I provide
        registration and login forms to create the initial user. Any role modification to another user must come via the user
        maintanamce screens.

        We also like images so it is possible to upload an image for just about anything. We can upload an image for user and role
        if we want. The images are small and are stored in mongodb as data url's. The applicationj also shows the use of modal screenns,
        tabs and dropdown lists.
